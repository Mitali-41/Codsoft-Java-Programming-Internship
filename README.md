Task 1:- **Number Game**. 
This Java program is a simple **Number Guessing Game** where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game allows multiple rounds, with players having the option to continue or quit after each round. A scoring system rewards players based on the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number, encouraging quicker guesses. The program includes robust error handling to ensure valid input, such as checking for numbers within the range and managing invalid entries gracefully. Players receive dynamic feedback during the game, such as hints if their guess is too high or too low. The game maintains a cumulative score across rounds and concludes by displaying the playerâ€™s final score, making it both interactive and engaging. This project serves as an excellent introduction to using loops, conditional statements, and error handling in Java.

Task 3:- **ATM Interface**. 
This Java program implements a simple **ATM Interface** that allows users to manage a bank account through options like depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking the current balance. The program consists of two main classes: `BankAccount`, which handles account operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry, and `ATM`, which provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to interact with the bank account. The `ATMInterface` class serves as the entry point, initializing a bank account with a default balance and linking it to the ATM. The program incorporates input validation, ensuring secure and reliable transactions, making it an excellent demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

Task 4:- **Currency Converter**. 
This Java program is a simple **Currency Converter** that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using predefined exchange rates. Users can input a base currency, a target currency, and the amount they wish to convert. The program calculates the converted amount by applying the appropriate exchange rate and displays the result. It includes mock exchange rates for common currencies such as USD, INR, and EUR, with a default rate of 1.0 for conversions within the same currency. This project demonstrates user input handling, basic arithmetic operations, and conditional logic in Java, making it an excellent starting point for understanding the basics of currency conversion.
